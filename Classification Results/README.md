The selection of classification algorithms in the proposed system was guided by a rigorous evaluation of 16 different classifiers, 
with their performance assessed at each classification level (detailed in Supplementary Information, Online Resource 5), including RF, 
Gradient Boosting (GB), AdaBoost, SVM , Logistic Regression (LR) , Bagging , k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) , Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), 
Decision Trees (DT) , Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) , XGBoost, LGBM , CatBoost , ET , QDA , and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
