#We systematically recorded the feature importance values across the six techniques for each dataset and voting method. These importance values were compiled to assess the contribution of each biomarker to the classification task. Then, the voting mechanism was implemented, where each feature received a vote based on its selection by the different methods. The total number of votes determined the overall significance of a feature, facilitating the identification of the most relevant biomarkers. The final results, detailing the importance of values and voting outcomes, were compiled and made available in this folder#
